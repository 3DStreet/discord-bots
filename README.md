# Experimental 3DStreet discord bots

Thanks to [invictus2010/dnd-ai-art-bot](https://github.com/invictus2010/dnd-ai-art-bot) for the inspiration. 

## Setup
You need two environmental variables:
* DISCORD_TOKEN to power your bot
* STABLE_DIFFUSION_TOKEN to connect to your Dreamstudio account

If you don't know where to find these values:

* Follow discord.py's [guide](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html) for creating a bot application. It's great--follow it step-by-step! It'll show you where to get the DISCORD_TOKEN
* You can find your Dreamstudio token by clicking into your membership settings over at Dreamstudio. Click on your profile's image -> Membership -> API Key.
